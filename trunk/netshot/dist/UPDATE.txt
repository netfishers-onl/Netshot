HOW TO UPDATE A WORKING INSTALLATION

### 1. You should always backup your data:
  * Your installation folder, e.g. /usr/local/netshot
  * Your drivers (if your have customized any), e.g. /usr/local/netshot/drivers
  * Your database
  * Your configuration file, e.g. /etc/netshot.conf

### 2. Stop Netshot

$ sudo service netshot stop

### 3. Copy the updated package

$ sudo cp netshot.jar /usr/local/netshot/netshot.jar

Overwrite the old version.

### 4. If you have made local changes to your drivers, or have written your
own drivers, you should ensure that they are compatible with the new version,
and you might want to adapt them.

### 5. Start Netshot

$ sudo service netshot start
