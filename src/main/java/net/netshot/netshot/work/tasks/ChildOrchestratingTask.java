 * Marks a group-based task that schedules per-device child tasks and stays RUNNING for the
 * whole orchestration (via {@code Task#orchestrateChildren}), in either PARALLEL or SEQUENTIAL
 * mode -- as opposed to other group-based tasks (e.g. CheckGroupComplianceTask,
 * CheckGroupSoftwareTask) which act on the whole group directly, without spawning/tracking
 * per-device children this way. Used by the REST layer to decide whether a RUNNING task can
 * still be cancelled (its own {@code cancelRequested} flag being polled by the orchestration
 * loop), regardless of which of the two schedule modes it's running in.
