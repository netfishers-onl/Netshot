/**
 * Base class for DB-backed test classes. A single PostgreSQL container is
 * shared by every subclass (mirroring {@link net.netshot.netshot.database.Database}'s
 * own static-singleton design): it is started once per JVM, in a static
 * initializer, the first time any subclass is loaded, and Testcontainers'
 * own Ryuk reaper container tears it down when the test JVM exits. Each
 * subclass gets its own schema within that container for isolation, similar
 * to how each used to get its own isolated in-memory H2 database.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately not a {@code @Testcontainers}/{@code @Container}
 * managed field: that extension only starts/stops a container around the
 * lifecycle of the single class it is declared on (per test method, or per
 * class instance with {@code @TestInstance(PER_CLASS)}), which does not fit
 * a container meant to be shared, already running, across several unrelated
 * top-level test classes.</p>
